# Whats this?

Simplest Go + HTMX example I could think of. When I tried to find something simple to look at I could only find Todo apps with layers upon layers of indirection...   


## External dependencies
* `github.com/google/uuid` to generate UUIDs
* `https://cdn.tailwindcss.com` in `html/templates/index.html` to center, flexify and style the buttons.

## How to run

```shell
go run main.go
```
